Socket.IO is an event-driven library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It consists of two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js. Both components have a nearly identical API.
Socket.IO primarily uses the WebSocket protocol with polling as a fallback option,[3] while providing the same interface. Although it can be used simply as a wrapper for WebSockets, it provides many more features, including broadcasting to multiple sockets, storing data associated with each client, and asynchronous I/O.
It can be installed with the Node Package Manager (NPM).
